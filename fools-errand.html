                The roar is now deafening, punctuated by distant <i>cracks</i> that send tremors through the ice.
                Beneath me, at the mouth of the crevice, one can actually see the current eating away at the walls.
                Being out of it is a relief but ... what <i>is</i> this place?
                We don't have fissures this wide and deep up north.
                Could we settle here, despite the noise and the risks?
            </p>
            <p>
                But wait, how come it <i>is</i> empty?
                Others have wandered in the past.
                Am I really the first to discover this place?
                Something's definitely wrong ...
            </p>
            <p>
                As if on cue, an ominous <i>growl</i> starts prowling from above.
                Then all hell breaks loose as the crevice opens.
                The current hits me from below, in a rush so sudden I almost pass out.
                For what seems like an eternity all I can see is a blur of walls flashing around me, sometimes so close I can touch them.
                Then I'm ... <i>out</i>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted-custom">
                Oh the cold !
                At first I can't seem to see anything, but then ...
                This is amazing !
                The ice ... is <i>below</i> !
                And is curved !
                It's a globe !
                I knew it !
                And there's more !
                Black empty space is filled with shiny, sparkling dots.
                And there is this brilliant stripe all around...
                And finally, to my right ... I don't think anyone can imagine something this big.
                A huge yellow ... bubble of ...
                But I've run out of time.
                I won't be able to tell anyone.
                This is what I've been yearning for all my life.
                This is why I just couldn't sit nice and tight with you.
                I wish you would see this.
                I wish you would see me.
