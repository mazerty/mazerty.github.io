    <h1>Fool's Errand</h1>
    <p>
        The roar is now deafening, punctuated by distant <i>cracks</i> that send tremors through the ice.<br>
        Beneath me, at the mouth of the crevice, one can actually <i>see</i> the current eating away at the walls...
    </p>
    <p>
        Being out of it is a relief but... what <i>is</i> this place ?<br>
        We don't have fissures this wide and deep up north.<br>
        Could we settle here, despite the noise and the risks ?
    </p>
    <p>
        But wait, how come it's empty ?<br>
        Others have wandered in the past...<br>
        Am I really the first to discover this place ?<br>
        Something's wrong...
    </p>
    <p>
        As if on cue, an ominous <i>growl</i> starts prowling from above.<br>
        Then all hell breaks loose as the crevice <i>opens</i>.<br>
        The current hits me from below, in a rush so sudden I almost pass out.<br>
        For what seems an eternity all I see is a blur of walls flashing around me, sometimes so close I could touch it.<br>
        Then I'm... <i>out</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh the <b>cold</b> !<br>
        At first I can't seem to see anything, but then...<br>
        Oh <i>God</i> this is amazing !<br>
        The ice, The <i>ice</i> ! it's <i>below</i> me !<br>
        And it's.. curved !<br>
        It's a globe !<br>
        I knew it !
    </p>
    <p>
        But there's more !<br>
        Black empty space is filled with shiny, sparkling dots.<br>
        And there is this brilliant stripe all around...<br>
        And finally, to my right... I don't think anyone can imagine something this big.<br>
        A huge yellow... bubble of...
    </p>
    <p>
        But I've run out of time.<br>
        I won't be able to tell anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is what I've been yearning for all my life.<br>
        This is why I just couldn't sit nice and tight with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish you would see this.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wish you would see me.
