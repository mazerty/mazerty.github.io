The roar is now deafening, punctuated by distant _cracks_ that send tremors through the ice.
Beneath me, at the mouth of the crevice, one can actually see the current eating away at the walls.
Being out of it is a relief but ... what _is_ this place?
We don't have fissures this wide and deep up north.
Could we settle here, despite the noise and the risks?

But wait, how come it _is_ empty?
Others have wandered in the past.
Am I really the first to discover this place?
Something's definitely wrong ...

As if on cue, an ominous _growl_ starts prowling from above.
Then all hell breaks loose as the crevice opens.
The current hits me from below, in a rush so sudden I almost pass out.
For what seems like an eternity all I can see is a blur of walls flashing around me, sometimes so close I can touch them.
Then I'm ... _out_.

_Work in progress_
