#### 3E 427, 16 Last Seed (Day 1), 11 a.m.

Fresh start, fresh diary.
I'll have to check the shack for the old one someday, if I manage to get back to Cyrodiil that is.
Anyway, a lot happened since my last entry so let's get back to it!

The Umbacano job proved to be my downfall, as I got caught just as I left the manor.
Prison gossip told me Darelo had sold me out then bragged about it to some wench, stupid bastard!
That his death came from the Gray Fox himself I doubt very much though.

I spent a couple of months in jail, then got woken up one morning by a bunch of guards.
I fought them, only to get clubbed and knocked out.
When I came to, I was in the hold of some ship, together with a Dunmer called Jiub who told me we just reached Morrowind.
I can't believe I was unconscious the whole trip!

Anyway, nothing made sense.
We docked at some swampy town called Seyda Neen, where an Imperial official told me I had been pardoned by the Emperor himself.
Then some big shot knight gave me a fair amount of coins and ordered me to report to someone else, but didn't know exactly where I could find him.
Now I'm at the local tavern, raising my glass to the efficiency of the Imperial administration.
