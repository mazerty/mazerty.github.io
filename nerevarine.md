Fresh start, fresh diary.
I'll have to check the shack for the old one though.
If I manage to get back to Cyrodiil that is.
Anyway, a lot happened since my last entry, so let's get back to it!

The Umbacano job proved to be my downfall, as I got caught just as I left the manor.
Prison gossip told me Darelo had sold me out then bragged about it to some wench, stupid bastard.
That his death came from the Gray Fox himself I doubt very much though.
